	<h3>More on Type Design</h3>
	<p>Round characters need to sit below the baseline so they can feel more stable and appear to be the same size as correesponding flat-based characters. Pointy characters will extend even farther below or above the typical flat-terminals to feel evened-out.</p>

	<h3>Type Treatments</h3>
	<p>Whenever you use a font, you should pay attention to three particular things: kerning, tracking, and leading.</p>

	<p>Kerning is the adjustment of space between pairs of letters. In a lot of free fonts, not all the character combinations have been kerned. This may result in awkward gaps between letters (such as A and V). To fix this, you may have to go in and kern your type by hand. Practice kerning with <a href="http://type.method.ac/" target="_blank">Kern Type</a>.</p>

	<p>Tracking is the adjustment of space for entire groups of letters. This is different from tracking because it is not only between two letters, it may be for an entire line or paragraph. Tracking affects legibility greatly, so take care that your tracking is not too wide or too narrow. Selective tracking can help you even out the rag in your paragraphs. You should not have very wide tracking for lowercase letters; it makes it very hard to read.</p>

	<p>Leading is the adjustment of space between baselines of text. It is also known as line spacing. Effective leading can enhance readability of block text. Ideal leading should be 120-145% of the font size.</p>

	<h3>Type Pairing</h3>
	<p>There are several ways to pair typefaces:</p>

		<li>Contrast</li>
		<li>Weight</li>
		<li>Style</li>
		<li>Classification</li>
		<li>Structure</li>

	<h3>Activity</h3>
	<p>1. Find a partner and work together to brainstorm ways to represent a word you draw out of the bag using only itself. See examples <a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/misc/Word_Lecture.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://typepolice.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/typography-exercise/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<p>2. Pair up and represent three different voices through pairing different typefaces for the phrase you've been given. See an example <a href="https://vimeo.com/109753129" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Homework</h3>
	<p>Decide on your book idea. Decide if you want to write your own copy or use some content is legally available for use (check out <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> for books with expired copyright). 

	<p>Then, pick your anchor typeface for your book. The body text is a good place to start, since that will feature all the main content. Decide on how you want to compliment your body text. Do you want to pair it with a serif for your header font? A sans-serif? A script? Do you want to letter your titles? </p>

	<p>After you've settled on your typeface choices, design two pages. This can be your cover and your table of contents, or two pages with text.</p>
