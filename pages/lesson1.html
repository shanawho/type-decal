			To start learning about typography, we must start with where it all beginsâ€”the single letterform. After all, a word is but a sum of all its letters. By studying how letterforms are designed and how they interact with each other, we are able to understand the care and detail that goes into creating meaningful visual communication.

		<h3>Activity</h3>
		<p>Today in class we're going to be creating letterforms from scratch with everyone's favorite thing... food! Hopefully you brought some snacks to share.</p>

		<p>Have fun experimenting with creating interesting, evocative, and legible letterforms while snacking and getting to know your new classmates! Take some pictures to document your delicious letters!</p>


		<h3>Homework</h3>
		<p>For homework, your task is to create a piece of handmade typography. Choose a word, think about what it represents and how you can create it using ordinary objects. Or go backwards, and choose your medium first, then figure out your word! Either way, be creative and have fun! Sky is the limit, but absolutely no hand-drawn or vectorized type.</p>

		<p>Document your handmade typography project and upload it Behance. Remember to add this decal's <span class="smallcaps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/typedecal" target="_blank">Behance</a></span> as a contributor.</p>

		<p>Think up two questions you have about your work in order to get some feedback from your peers in our first homework critique session.</p>


		<h3>Midterm Project</h3>
		<p>Your midterm project will be to design a book, with a minimum of eight pages. This project is due March 17, which gives you six weeks. For this first week, try to come up with a concept of what your book will be about. You are welcome to write your own copy, or to use material that is free to use (check the copyright).</p>
