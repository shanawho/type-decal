      This week will build on your handmade explorations of type but will also introduce you to the more familiar concept of drawing letters via hand or mouse. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Handlettering is simply the drawing of letters by hand. Often executed with brush pens or other writing utensils, it bears some similarity to calligraphy. However, the difference is that calligraphy creates letters in one stroke. Handlettering allows for the building up and refining of letters through drawing them little by little.

      There is also digital lettering, in which letters are typically created by adjusting bezier curves in vector illustration programs like Adobe Illustrator. <a href="http://shape.method.ac/" target="_blank">Shape Type</a> is a game which will help you start to learn how much detail and precision goes into crafting the letterforms you see in your daily life.

      Let's also talk a bit about the difference between lettering and type design. Lettering is the illustration of letterforms for a certain project. It encompasses the creation of only those letters seen in the project. Type design, on the other hand, encompasses creating complete alphabets for a typeface. Type designers also have to take into account special characters, ligatures, kerning, and all possible combinations of letters. It's a long, detailed process which can often take years from initial sketch to finished typeface..

    <h3>Activity</h3>
    <p></p>


    <h3>Homework</h3>
    <p>Inspired by Jessica Hische, your task is to create a dropcap for your favorite book. Take some time to think about what the book means and how you can represent that through lettering.</p>

    <p>Document your project (including sketches and process) on Behance.</p>

    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>Typography is more than just looks. It's about legibility. Get educated about what makes a useable typeface with these readings below.</p>
