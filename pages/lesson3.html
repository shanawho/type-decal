      There is also digital lettering, in which letters are typically created by adjusting bezier curves in vector illustration programs like Adobe Illustrator. <a href="http://shape.method.ac/" target="_blank">Shape Type</a> is a game which will help you start to learn how much detail and precision goes into crafting the letterforms you see in your daily life.

      Let's also talk a bit about the difference between lettering and type design. Lettering is the illustration of letterforms for a certain project. It encompasses the creation of only those letters seen in the project. Type design, on the other hand, encompasses creating complete alphabets for a typeface. Type designers also have to take into account special characters, ligatures, kerning, and all possible combinations of letters. It's a long, detailed process which can often take years from initial sketch to finished typeface..

			Serifs and sans-serifs are often the focus of typographic study. However, it's also important to note that there are plenty of typefaces that fall into the categories of display, script, and monospace. They just simply aren't used as often.
