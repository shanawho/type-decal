		<h2>Syllabus</h2>


		<p>
			Working with Typography is a UC Berkeley DeCal course intended to teach students about the foundations and applications of typography and lettering. The course will emphasize hands-on activities and assignments in which students will apply their knowledge and creativity to create several pieces of original work. Students will also hone their critical eye and practice giving feedback to their peers in weekly critique sessions. The course will help students grow as designers in both the practical and critical sense.
		</p>

		<p>
			Class will take place 2 hours each week from 7pm&ndash;9pm on Tuesdays. Classtime will be used for critiques, lessons, and activities.
		</p>


		<h3>Enrollment</h3>

			<p>
				Enrollment will be application-based. Interested students will be required to submit a short application and a small graphic design portfolio of 2-3 pieces which clearly demonstrates their visual design skillset (pieces which showcase typographic and/or lettering work are, of course, encouraged).
			</p>

			<p>
				Enrollment has been processed for Spring 2015.

		<h3>Attendance</h3>

				Attendance is mandatory. Students are allowed two absences. Anything more is grounds for failure.

		<h3>Homework</h3>

				Homeworks are intended to be exercises in creativity where students can apply what they've learned in class. There will be weekly assignments, each due the following week. The course will also include a midterm project and a final project, which will both be announced six weeks before their due date.
