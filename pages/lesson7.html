	<h3>Identity Design</h3>
	<p>Today we'll start exploring identity design. Identity design extends beyond just logos. It is the creation of a cohesive visual identity system that works across media. You are not just designing a logo. You are designing a brand, responsible for effectively communicating your client or products message to your audience.</p>

	<p>Designing a logo is a good place to start developing your brand identity. Do research on what your brand is supposed to encompass. Make an inspiration board. Surround yourself with imagery that inspires you about the message you're trying to communicate.</p>

	<p>Use a pencil and start sketching different logo ideas that come to mind. This is your brainstorming stage. Don't limit yourself. After you've sketched at least fifty ideas on paper, look through them to find which ones work. Take those and begin to vectorize them. on the computer. See Aaron Draplin's logo design process below for some inspiration.</p>
